This website will enable companies to put up job offers as well as contracts for
students of the Cégep de l'Outaouais. Students will also be able to create
profiles to show off their abilities and will be able to post service offers.

## Inspirations

This project is based on a lot of other people's code, which we tried to credit
in comments all over the code. Most of the UI is heavily inspired and/or comes
from [Tailwind UI](https://tailwindui.com/).

## Tech stuff

The website will be built using Svelte for its simplicity and ease of use. It is
also much easier to learn quickly, from my experience than bigger frameworks
like React or Angular. This will be necessary since I don't have much time or
experience with such frameworks. As for the CSS framework, we started out using
Bootstrap, but finally went with Tailwind since it's much more flexible.

For the backend, we will be using Firebase since it's pretty much an all-in-one
solution for a backend. It will enable user authentication, storage of
preferences, job postings as well as document storage (eg. Resumes).
